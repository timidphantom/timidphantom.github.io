        <p>Hello! I'm Leon, but you can call me Myo, or really, anything you desire... ^_^ You might know me as PDB user <a href="https://www.personality-database.com/user/372182">mayoi</a> as well. I'm mostly interested in Enstars, so I primarily write arguments for it. I'm a RyuseitaiP and AlkureiP. I also enjoy Splatoon, Project Sekai, MILGRAM, and Free!, so you might find me on those pages as well.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have collections for my favs, arguments, and other things too... I'm running out of things to say, I'm terribly sorry. It's nice to meet you...!</p>
        <br>
        <p>...Why are you still here? Standing, staring? What is it that you want from me? My kinlist? Is that it? Freak.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section onions" id="onions"><p>Despite my 3L-4isms, I do manage to have a few opinions here and there... I'll share.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There are numerous type incompatibilities across systems. There are aspects of certain types which directly contradict each other.</li>
            <li>The Grant function stack is restricting. The Nucleus stack or EEII/IIEE is just as acceptable. A SiFi user is an ISFJ, not an ISTJ.</li>
            <li>Loop theory was a mistake. Please stop typing based off loops. Stop typing based off inferior functions/grips as well.</li>
            <li>Definitions on how tert functions manifest are too inconsistent for me to regard them with any importance.</li>
            <li>Enneagram wings, whilst kinda fun, are superfluous. Someone's tritype fixes says more about them than their wing does.</li>
            <li>Patterns of integration and disintegration don't make sense when Enneagram is inherently about neurosis.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section contact" id="contact">
            <p>If you'd ever like to discuss typology, I'm always open to it! Pleaasee just keep in mind that I'm slightly unsocialized and very, very anxious. Feel free to approach me, but I might be a bit strange; I deeply apologize.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I don't have any public social media accounts anymore, so I can't give any links. However, if we're mutuals on PDB, you can always ask for my Discord either via PDB mail or on my personal page. Feel free to comment on my personal page at any time, actually...! I like making new friends...!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thank you for visiting... and when it comes to typology, there is always more for all of us to learn. ^_^</p>
